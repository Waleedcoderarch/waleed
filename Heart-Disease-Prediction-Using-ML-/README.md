# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Optimized Feature Engineering and Machine Learning

## 📌 Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are a growing global concern, leading to an increase in sudden cardiac deaths. Traditional detection methods are slow and often ineffective. This project proposes a **machine learning-based approach** using optimized **feature engineering** to predict the presence and **severity of heart disease**.

A combination of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **parallel processing**, and **advanced ML algorithms** (including Gradient Boosting and Stacking Classifier) is used to enhance prediction accuracy. The system achieves **100% accuracy** with **0.003s processing time** using the Gradient Boosting Classifier.

## ❌ Existing System

Heart disease detection systems currently face limitations like:

- Use of **limited or imbalanced datasets** (e.g., UCI dataset with only 303 entries).
- **Lack of optimized feature selection**, leading to overfitting or underfitting.
- **Poor generalization** to unseen patient data.
- **Limited severity-level classification**, focusing only on binary prediction.
- **Slow processing speed** due to lack of parallelization.

## ✅ Proposed System

Our proposed system addresses these issues with:

- A **combined dataset (1025 records)** from Kaggle (Cleveland, Hungarian, Statlog, Long Beach).
- **Data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and **correlation heatmaps**.
- **Feature Engineering Pipeline**:
  - `StandardScaler`
  - `SelectKBest` (ANOVA F-test)
  - `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` – reduced to 8 components
- Use of **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning
- **5-fold cross-validation** for robust evaluation
- **Parallel processing (Joblib)** to reduce training time
- A web-based prediction interface built using **Flask**
